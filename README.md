# Fireworks
This is an experioment to create an interactive program for my friends and fmaily to enjoy on the Fourth of July. 

The program will taske input form a piano keyboard and generate firework graphics on a screen. The keys palyed will impact the height (y position) at which the firework 'bursts'. Other variables of each firework object will include color, pattern, radius, x postion ont he scren, and the speed at which the graphics 'fade out'. 

At this time, the method of 'drawing' is up in the air. (Pun intended lol)

This project is meant to be a fun way to focus my experimentation and reintroduction to concepts I learned previously but have not been framiliar with in quite some time.
